Simple Part Organizer

v1.0
Felbourn here. The original mod was written by MrShifty. I am taking this over from him and calling what he did revision 1. The only change otherwise is to make this compatible with KSP 0.23 by fixing a null reference exception in the "Total Mass" sort routine.

v0.250
Fixes:
- Made the mod filter window scrollable
- Truncated text so it fits on the buttons
- Internal changes to make more efficient code
Additions:
- Added Default button to the sort window
- Filter settings now persistent between sessions

v0.200
- Added filter regime: part type
- Added Select All and De-Select All buttons to the filter panels
- Changed license to GPLv3

v0.100 - Initial release.
- 5 sorting regimes: title, manufacturer, size, dry mass, total mass
- 2 filtering regimes: mod, size
